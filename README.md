# Useful-Unity-Assets
> A collection of useful Unity assets and scripts I have made for myself.

Feel free to use them in any project you want (noncommercial or commercial). No need to credit me, but it would be appreciated. I would love to see your projects aswell!

- Import/download the latest `.unitypackage` from [releases](https://github.com/Centribo/Useful-Unity-Assets/releases) into your editor

  - [ScriptTemplates](./Assets/ScriptTemplates/) - C# script templates for Unity. Copy this folder into the root of your project's `Assets` folder, then restart Unity editor. You can use these by going to `Assets > Create > C# Templates`.
