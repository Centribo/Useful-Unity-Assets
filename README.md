# Useful-Unity-Assets
> A collection of useful Unity assets and scripts I have made for myself.

Feel free to use them in any project you want (noncommercial or commercial).

No need to credit me, but it would be appreciated. I would love to see your projects aswell!

Credits to [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) for art assets for some examples.
